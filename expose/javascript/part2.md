1. The program will output "3".
2. The program will output "150".
3. The program will output "150".
4. The program will return "[50, 100, 150]". The function goes through the given array, applies the discount on each element, and pushes the new price into discounted.
5. Error. i is declared within the for loop so it can't be called outside of that code block.
6. Error. discountedPrice is declared within the for loop so it can't be called outside of that code block.
7. The program will output "150".
8. The program will return "[50, 100, 150]". The function goes through the given array, applies the discount on each element, and pushes the new price into discounted.
9. Error. i is declared within the for loop so it can't be called outside of that code block.
10. The program will output "3". length is mot modified and is called within the code block.
11. The program will return "[50, 100, 150]". The function goes through the given array, applies the discount on each element, and pushes the new price into discounted.
12. 
    1. student.name 
    2. student['Grad Year']
    3. student.greeting()
    4. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
    5. student.courseLoad[0]
13. 
    1. '32'. Because '+' is used, the number is converted to a string and concatenated.
    2. 1. Because '-' is used, the string is converted to the number 3.
    3. 3. Null is treated as 0 because it is added to a number.
    4. '3null'. Null becomes a string because it is added to a string.
    5. 4. True is equal to 1 when added to a number.
    6. 0. Both null and false are treated as numbers.
    7. 3undefined. Undefined becomes a string because it is added to a string.
    8. NaN. Because '-' is used, 3 becomes a string and undefined becomes NaN.
14. 
    1. True. '2' is converted to a number, which is greater than 1.
    2. False. '12' comes before '2' in dictionary order.
    3. True. '2' is converted to a number, which is equal to 2.
    4. False. They are two different types.
    5. False. True is equal to the number 1, which is not equal to 2.
    6. True. Boolean(2) is equal to the number 2.
15. '==' checks equality with type conversion while '===' checks equality without type conversion.
17. [2, 4, 6]. Here we pass the function doSomething as a parameter of modifyArray. modifyArray takes the given array and the function doSomething and modifies the array, which is multiply each element by 2 in this case.
